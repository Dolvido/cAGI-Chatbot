This project aims to create an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system that mimics human cognitive processes. It integrates modules for core functionality, knowledge base, learning and memory, perception and action, and a user-friendly interface. The goal is to develop AGI that understands, learns, adapts, and interacts with it's environment.
